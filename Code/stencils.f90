      subroutine sum_fluxes(av,flux_i,flux_j,area,prop,dcell)

!     This subroutine sums the fluxes into each cell, calculates the change in 
!     the cell property inside, distributes the change to the four nodes of the
!     cell and then adds it onto the flow property

!     Explicitly declare the required variables
      use types
      implicit none
      type(t_appvars), intent(in) :: av
      real, intent(in) :: flux_i(:,:), flux_j(:,:), area(:,:)
      real, intent(inout) :: prop(:,:)
      real, intent(out) :: dcell(:,:)
      real, dimension(size(prop,1),size(prop,2)) :: dnode
      integer :: ni, nj

!     Get the block size and store locally for convenience
      ni = size(prop,1); nj = size(prop,2)

!     Use the finite volume method to find the change in the variables "prop"
!     over the timestep "dt", save it in the array "dprop_cell"
!     INSERT

!     Now distribute the changes equally to the four corners of each cell. Each 
!     interior grid point receives one quarter of the change from each of the 
!     four cells adjacent to it.
!     INSERT

!     Bounding edge nodes do not have four adjacent cells and so must be treated
!     differently, they only recieve half the change from each of the two
!     adjacent cells. Distribute the changes for the "i = 1 & ni" edges as well
!     as the "j = 1 & nj" edges. 
!     INSERT

!     Finally distribute the changes to be to the four bounding corner points, 
!     these receive the full change from the single cell of which they form one 
!     corner.
!     INSERT

!     Update the solution by adding the changes at the nodes "dnode" to the flow
!     property "prop"
!     INSERT

      end subroutine sum_fluxes

      subroutine smooth_array(av,prop)

!     This subroutine smooths "prop" to stabilise the calculation, the basic 
!     solver uses second order smoothing, many improvements are possible.

!     Explicitly declare the required variables
      use types
      implicit none
      type(t_appvars), intent(in) :: av
      real, intent(inout) :: prop(:,:)
      real, dimension(size(prop,1),size(prop,2)) :: prop_avg
      integer :: ni, nj

!     Get the block size and store locally for convenience
      ni = size(prop,1); nj = size(prop,2)

!     Calculate the average values at the nodes in the interior region of the
!     mesh, use the four neighbouring nodes in the plus and minus i and 
!     j-directions.
!     INSERT

!     Edge values are also averaged in both the i and j-directions. Parallel to
!     the boundary the averaging is centred, the averages of two nodes are taken
!     either side of the current point. Perpendicular to the boundary the
!     algorithm is one-sided, the value at the current point is extrapolated
!     from the values at two nodes away from the boundary point.
!     INSERT

!     The corner values are not currently smoothed
      prop_avg([1,ni],[1,nj]) = prop([1,ni],[1,nj])

!     Now apply the artificial viscosity by smoothing "prop" towards "prop_avg",
!     take (1-sfac) * the calculated value of the property + sfac * the average 
!     of the surrounding values. 
!     INSERT

      end subroutine smooth_array
